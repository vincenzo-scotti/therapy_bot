# Models

This directory is used to host the weights of pre-trained models.
These directories contain the checkpoints of the deep models that require wights to be locally available.
Refer to the following list to know which deep features model we used (N.B. not alla models require weights to be put here)

- [VGGish](https://research.google/pubs/pub45611/): model weights and implementation are available at the following [link](https://github.com/harritaylor/torchvggish) 
- [SoundNet](http://soundnet.csail.mit.edu): the original model weights and implementation are available at the following [link](https://github.com/cvondrick/soundnet), model weights converted for PyTorch are available at the following [link](https://github.com/smallflyingpig/SoundNet_Pytorch)
- [Wav2Vec 2.0](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/wav2vec-20-learning-the-structure-of-speech-from-raw-audio/): model weights are available at the following [link](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53) and implementation is available at the following [link](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/wav2vec2)
